# Serebii-Search-Pokemon-By-Gen

This little tool helps you search serebii.net for whatever *Pok√©mon* you want with ease.
I made this for my BF because he likes doing Nuzlockes and searching Serebii can sometimes feel clunky and slow. This makes the process a lot quicker and easier.

I decided to make the quick project public because I feel like it could be a good learning tool for anyone interested. It's all **C#** and couples in with another project I made for finding all the pokemon and saving them into an easy to parse .txt file. This project takes that .txt file, converts it into a dictionary, and then takes a user input for a pokemon name and converts it into an ID to search Serebii. The user also input the generation they want to search.
